Predictive Maintenance and Fault Diagnosis in Power Transformers

This project implements a machine learning-based predictive maintenance framework for power transformers to enhance reliability and reduce downtime. By analyzing critical operational parameters and using algorithms like k-means clustering, SVM, Linear Regression, Anomaly Detection, and Random Forest, it accurately identifies and predicts fault conditions.
Key Features

    Data Analysis: Fault pattern identification using gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, etc.), health indices, and life expectancy metrics.
    Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, SVM, K-Means Clustering, and Isolation Forest for fault detection and anomaly identification.
    Feature Engineering: Focused on critical parameters like dielectric rigidity, water content, and power factor.

Methodology

    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, scaling, and encoding features for model readiness.
    Model Evaluation: Metrics like MSE and RÂ² for regression tasks; clustering and anomaly detection for pattern recognition.
    Comparative Analysis: Benchmarked against existing studies to highlight improved accuracy and predictive insights.

Implementation

    Language: Python
    Tools: Scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
    Applications: Transformer health assessment, fault prediction, and proactive maintenance.
